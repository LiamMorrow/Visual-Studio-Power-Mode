# Visual-Studio-Power-Mode
An extension that attempts to clone the power mode in Atom found here : https://atom.io/packages/activate-power-mode  
Feel free to fork and submit pull requests, I'm excited to see what we can add.  
Unfortunately, I couldn't figure out how to get the current text colour so for now it is just customizable. 


Settings can be found in the Tools > options > Power Mode menu.  

## 1.1.5 Release Notes 
Fixed settings loading issue  
Added random colour options
